# Battleship game (one player)
Simple one player battleship game written in Python.
Developing this game to increase my Python skill.

To run:
```
python /Python/battleshit.py
```

# Rules
* You have to guess the position of a 1x1 ship: row (1-5) and col (1-5).
* You have only 6 chances.
* In 4th round you earn tip (col or row, it's random.)
